# Persistence (Phase 6)

How research gets saved into the central knowledge base at `~/dev/research/`.

## Layout

```
~/dev/research/
  .db.sqlite3                   # FTS5 index, domain scores, verifier log
  README.md                     # auto-bootstrapped

  review-due.md                 # AUTO: staleness-ranked
  PORTFOLIO.md                  # AUTO (v0.3): master corpus index, by project + cross-cutting
  SOURCE-LEDGER.md              # AUTO: sources across entries and runs
  topics/
    <top-level>/
      <slug>.md                 # canonical entries
  indices/
    <top-level>.md              # AUTO: Map of Content per top-level topic
  archive/
    <slug>.md                   # moved, never deleted
    raw/<slug>.md               # pre-compress Raw excerpts
  verifier-log/<slug>/<atom>.json   # per-claim verification artifacts (v0.2+)
  calculation-receipts/<id>.json    # append-only deterministic math receipts
  graphs/research-graph.md          # generated dependency graph; not mixed with topic MOCs
  runs/<run-id>/                    # run contract + task packets, outside plugin git
  telemetry/hook-events.jsonl       # bounded local hook status metadata
  inbox/                        # unrefined fleeting notes; populated by /research:ingest --inbox
```

Plugin-managed projects (entries saved with `projects: [foo]` frontmatter) get a single symlink in the central data store:

```
~/dev/research/projects/
  <project-name>/
    INDEX.md                    # generated central project index
    <slug>.md                   # symlink -> ~/dev/research/topics/<top>/<slug>.md
```

No files are written into the project directory by default. Pass `--with-project-index` to `/research:save` if you also want `<project>/RossLabs-Research.md` written (opt-in).

The plugin repository stores runtime code and synthetic fixtures only. Canonical entries, captures, indexes, run packets, receipts, and telemetry use `RESEARCH_CONTENT_DIR` and `RESEARCH_INDEX_DIR`, which default to `~/dev/research/`.

## Historical source migration

Existing entries may have a `sources:` list but no normalized source observation because they predate the audit schema. Preview migration first:

```bash
python3 "$RESEARCH_PLUGIN_ROOT/research.py" legacy-source-import
```

After reviewing the counts, apply it explicitly:

```bash
python3 "$RESEARCH_PLUGIN_ROOT/research.py" legacy-source-import --apply
```

The import never invents dates or hashes. It writes stable append-only records with explicit unknown-reason metadata and an earliest ordering sentinel for an unknown capture date. `doctor` continues to report these incomplete observations until a real recapture supplies a content hash and date; that is evidence debt, not an import failure.

Linked external directories (registered via `/research:link-project <name> <path>`) are tracked in a registry:

```
~/dev/research/
  .linked-projects.json         # {"<name>": {"path", "linked", "files": [{name, relpath, title, summary, mtime, size}]}}
  projects/
    <name>/
      <filename>.md             # symlinks to files inside the registered source dir
```

The source directory is never modified. `/research:index` re-scans every registered linked project, refreshing file lists and symlinks.

## Slug rules

- Dendron-style dot-hierarchy: `<top-level>.<sub>.<specific>`. Examples:
  - `prompting.chain-of-thought`
  - `prompting.techniques.few-shot`
  - `db.postgres.pgvector`
  - `design.calm-precision.forms`
- Lowercase kebab-case segments. No spaces.
- Top-level = the folder under `~/dev/research/topics/`. Subsequent segments are purely in the filename.
- Collision handling: if the exact slug exists with today's date, append `-v2`, `-v3`, ...

## Frontmatter schema

**Required fields:** slug, title, topics, projects, status, created, reviewed, sources. Everything else defaults.

For standard and deep research, each `sources[]` item should preserve the source register fields when known: `role` (primary/original, independent-corroboration, counter-evidence, temporal/currentness, gap-lead) and `independence` (why it is independent, shared-lineage, derivative, or original).

For extracted, uploaded, local, or mixed-file sources, also preserve intake fields when known: `content_hash`, `parser`, `parser_version`, `extraction_status`, `extraction_confidence`, `provenance_granularity`, `raw_ref`, and `parse_notes`. These fields let future searches distinguish a high-quality source from a weak extraction of a good source.

## Extraction — which tool for which source

Phase 2-3 research populates the `## Raw` section. Pick the right extractor per source type:

| Source | Tool | Why |
|---|---|---|
| HTML page (URL) | `WebFetch` | Built-in, returns markdown |
| Short PDF (≤10 pages, simple text) | `Read` with `pages` param | Built-in, fast, no deps |
| Any PDF (long, tables, scanned text) | `/research:extract <path>` | Routes to `@tyroneross/omniparse` |
| Excel (`.xlsx`, `.xls`, `.csv`, `.tsv`, `.ods`, `.xlsb`) | `/research:extract <path>` | Omniparse; `--sheet NAME` to pick one |
| PowerPoint (`.pptx`) | `/research:extract <path>` | Omniparse; `--no-notes` to strip speaker notes |
| Python source (`.py`) | `/research:extract <path>` | Omniparse — AST-level structured markdown |
| Whole docs directory | `/research:extract <dir> -r` | Omniparse recursive walk |
| Markdown / plain text / JSON / YAML | `Read` | Stdlib covers it; `/research:extract` rejects these |

For mixed, visual-heavy, table-heavy, or reusable source sets, apply `deep-research-architecture.md` before synthesis. The result should be an intake manifest plus normalized evidence records, not only a pasted text blob.

### Omniparse

`/research:extract` routes everything through `@tyroneross/omniparse` — a user-authored Node.js CLI (FSL-1.1-MIT) that ships **vendored** inside this plugin at `vendor/omniparse/dist/bin/omniparse.js`. The vendored build is self-contained: all runtime deps (xlsx, sax, p-limit) are inlined, so no `npm install` is needed. Only `node >= 18` must be on PATH. No external Python extraction libraries are used. PDF handling is basic text extraction (no table or formula recognition). If academic PDF fidelity ever blocks real work, the right fix is to extend Omniparse rather than add another dependency.

Omniparse binary resolution (in order):
1. `omniparse` on `PATH` (allows a user-installed global override).
2. Vendored self-contained build at `<plugin-root>/vendor/omniparse/dist/bin/omniparse.js` invoked via `node`.

If neither resolves, the command explains that the vendored copy is missing or `node` isn't installed, and points at `vendor/omniparse/BUILD.md` for re-vendoring instructions.

### Caching

Every successful extract is cached at `~/dev/research/.extract-cache/<sha256>-<flags>.md`. The cache key combines the file's SHA-256 (or a directory-listing hash for directories) with the active flag signature (`-f`, `-r`, `--sheet`, `--no-notes`). Re-reading the same file with the same flags is instant. Use `--no-cache` to force re-extract. Safe to delete the cache dir at any time.

Guiding rule: **non-LLM parsers do extraction, the host agent does synthesis.** Paste the markdown verbatim into `## Raw`, under a heading with the source path, capture date, parser, flags, content hash/cache key, extraction confidence, and parse notes. The verifier chunks this later.

### Parse provenance

Each raw source block should start with a compact provenance header when available:

```markdown
### /path/to/source.pdf (captured 2026-07-08)
- source_id: S1
- content_hash: `sha256:<64 lowercase hex>`
- parser: omniparse
- parser_flags: -f markdown
- extraction_status: success
- extraction_confidence: medium
- provenance_granularity: page/section
- parse_notes: tables may be flattened; charts not independently extracted
```

Use `high` confidence for native text with stable section/page provenance, `medium` for parser output that appears usable but may flatten layout, and `low` for OCR/scans/visual tables/formulas where meaning may be incomplete.

## Three-layer template

```markdown
## TL;DR

≤150 words. Standalone. Extractive: reuse bolded phrases from Notes verbatim. Lead with the answer.

## Notes

Body. **Bold key passages** (Forte's progressive summarization). Use `[[prompting.techniques.few-shot]]` for backlinks. Cite inline as `[T1: https://arxiv.org/...]`.

Wrap numeric/code/symbolic claims so the verifier can find them:
`{claim: "CoT improves GSM8K accuracy from 17.9% to 58.1%", atom_id: a1}`

## Raw

Verbatim extracts. One section per source:

### https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903 (captured 2026-04-17)
[Paste the `WebFetch` markdown output verbatim, trimmed to relevant portions.]

### https://www.anthropic.com/research/... (captured 2026-04-17)
[Paste `WebFetch` output.]
```

The Raw layer is what FTS5 indexes for retrieval and what the v0.2 verifier chunks.

## Project association (v0.3.1)

When `projects[]` is non-empty, `research.py save` maintains one symlink per project in the central data store:

- `~/dev/research/projects/<project-name>/<slug>.md` → `~/dev/research/topics/<top>/<slug>.md`

That is the only side-effect by default. The project directory itself is not touched. The project need not even exist at `~/dev/git-folder/<name>/` — the symlink is keyed by project name, not file system location.

**Opt-in project index**: pass `--with-project-index` to also regenerate `<project>/RossLabs-Research.md` inside the project directory. Useful when you want the research surfaced to anyone browsing the repo (for example, humans reviewing a PR). Off by default so saves stay non-invasive.

**Master view**: `~/dev/research/PORTFOLIO.md` is regenerated on every save (unless `--no-index`) with a dedicated "Plugin-managed projects" section.

## Linked external directories (v0.3.1)

Some projects already have research directories the plugin did not author (for example `~/projects/example-app/docs/research/` with 17 markdown files in flat/plain format). Copying them into the plugin's layout would be destructive; instead, register them.

```
python research.py link-project example-app --path ~/projects/example-app/docs/research/
# or: /research:link-project example-app ~/projects/example-app/docs/research/
```

What happens:

1. Walks the source directory recursively for `*.md` files.
2. For each file, extracts a title (first `# H1`, or filename stem) and a 1-line summary (first paragraph, first sentence, truncated to ~120 chars). Pure deterministic — no LLM calls.
3. Records the registration in `~/dev/research/.linked-projects.json` as `{<name>: {path, linked, files: [{name, relpath, title, summary, mtime, size}]}}`.
4. Indexes the linked files in SQLite FTS so `/research:search --project <name>` can retrieve them without copying them into canonical topics.
5. Creates symlinks at `~/dev/research/projects/<name>/<filename>` pointing to the real files.
6. Appends a "Linked external research directories" section to `~/dev/research/PORTFOLIO.md`.

The source directory is never modified. Re-running the command refreshes the registration and symlinks; `/research:index` also re-scans every registered linked project (detects new files, removes deleted ones, refreshes summaries).

Use link-project whenever the research predates the plugin or lives in a deliberate non-plugin layout; use save + `projects:` when the plugin authored the entry and you want it associated.

## Legacy v0.3.0 artifacts

If a project contains `<project>/research/` file copies, `<project>/research/.live/` symlinks, or `<project>/RossLabs-Research.md` from v0.3.0, those are preserved as-is. v0.3.1 does not write to these paths by default, but also does not delete them. A one-time informational note is printed when the plugin touches a project with such artifacts, listing what's there so the user can choose to clean them up manually.

## Update vs create

- Same `slug` + same `created` date → update (overwrite entry file, rewrite frontmatter).
- Same `slug` + different `created` → append `-v2` suffix.
- Always update `reviewed: <today>` on any edit.

## Retroactive linking

If you realize later that research `prompting.chain-of-thought` is relevant to a project:

1. Edit frontmatter to add the project: `projects: [atomize-ai]`.
2. Run `python research.py link prompting.chain-of-thought ~/projects/example-app`.
3. Script creates the symlink and appends to that project's `INDEX.md`.

## Archival (v0.3 preview)

`python research.py archive <slug>` moves the file to `archive/<slug>.md`, sets `status: archived`, and leaves a 3-line redirect stub at the original path so `[[...]]` links from other entries still resolve. Never `rm`.

## Bootstrap

On any invocation, if `~/dev/research/` is missing, `research.py` creates the full layout, the SQLite DB with FTS5 tables, and seeds `domain_scores` from `data/domain-scores-seed.json` (v0.2+).
